A branch in the code when a decision is either true or false. This will change the path of the code.

```python
money = 200.56

if money > 10.00:  #true
    print("You can by the book")
```

In this example if the money is more than 10.00 then it will print a message.

```python
username = "Paul"
password = "123"

if username == "Paul" and password =="123":
    print("you have logged in")
else:
    print("username or password incorrect")
```

In this example both values must be true.

```python
username = input("What is your username? ")
password = input("What is your password? ")
```

You can improve this with inputs to get the information from the user.
