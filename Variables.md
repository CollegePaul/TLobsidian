Variables allow us to store data or information. 
Must be 1 work, and can't start with number.
Choosing the correct data type is essential for performance and accuracy.

this is a new line

```python 
age = 16  # Integer
money = 2.25  # float / double
name = "Paul"  # string
raining = True  # Boolean
shopping = ["Chocolate", "Coke", "Apple"] # List / Array
```

### Naming conventions:

A consistent approach to how to name variables, using an underscore, or capitalisation.

```python
total_cost = 30.20  # Snake case  - typical for python
total_gravity_force_effect = 20.1 # good
tgfe = 20.1 # harder to understand.
a = 20.1 # bad

totalCost = 40.32 # Cammal Case
totalGravityForceEffect = 20.1


class TotalCost():  #Pascal case - use for classes
    print("40.20")
```
